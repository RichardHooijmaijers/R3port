# Rout package
The Rout package is written to easily create pdf and html documents including tables, listings and plots.
Although there are other options to do this within R, this package takes a somewhat different approach.
It aims to be flexible in a way that it can be used with other *reporting* packages but also as standalone.
Furthermore, the template system makes it possible to fully customize the style of the reports.
