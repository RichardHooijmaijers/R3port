# R3port package
The aim of this package is to easily create pdf and html documents including tables, listings and plots.
Although there are multiple options to do this within R like `knitr` and `rmarkdown`, this package takes a different approach.
Output can be created using various function and is intended to create reports with only tables, listings and plots.
It aims to be flexible in a way that it can be used with other *reporting* packages but also as standalone.
Furthermore, the template system makes it possible to fully customize the style of the reports.
